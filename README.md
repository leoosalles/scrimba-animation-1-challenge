# scrimba-animation-1-challenge
This project demonstrates a simple loading animation using HTML and CSS. The animation consists of three circular elements that continuously grow and change color in a smooth, looping motion. It provides a visually appealing effect that can be integrated into various web applications.
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Three animated circles that expand and change color.
  </li>
  <li>
    Smooth, continuous animation using CSS <code>@keyframes</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fully responsive design ensuring proper alignment across different screen sizes.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>HTML5:</strong> Defines the structure of the webpage.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CSS3:</strong> Creates the animations and styles the elements.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>
  The animation is handled using the <code>growAndLighten</code> keyframes:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The circles start at their original size and dark gray color.
  </li>
  <li>
    Midway through the animation, they expand slightly and change to a lighter shade.
  </li>
  <li>
    The effect continuously loops, creating a smooth pulsating animation.
  </li>
</ol>
